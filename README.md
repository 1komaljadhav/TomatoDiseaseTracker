ABSTRACT 
Plant diseases threaten agricultural productivity, leading to significant economic losses. Timely detection and accurate identification are vital for effective disease management. This research compares the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), AlexNet, and InceptionV3 in detecting plant diseases from leaf images. Using a dataset from Kaggle, we evaluate each model's accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive system that not only detects diseases but also suggests fertilizer application and disease mitigation precautions. By integrating machine learning with practical recommendations, our study aids agricultural practitioners in selecting the best disease detection model and implementing effective management strategies for healthier crops
